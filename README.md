# FlexSell Wholesale - Enterprise B2B & Dropshipping Market Platform

FlexSell Wholesale is a next-generation, enterprise-grade B2B e-commerce platform designed for direct manufacturer-to-retailer supply chain networks, bulk ordering, dropshipping fulfillment, and regional tax/logistics distribution. It features advanced variant matrix logic, SKU-first search algorithms, real-time inventory controls with camera barcode scanning, and an integrated Indian GST taxation engine.

## 🎯 Platform Purpose & Architectural Core

FlexSell Wholesale bridges the gap between manufacturers/distributors and wholesale retailers or dropshippers. The platform enables multi-tier pricing models, high-volume bulk variant purchases, automated commercial tax invoices, and real-time inventory synchronization.

### Key Technical Factors:
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, Server Components & Dynamic Client Views)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS custom variables, smooth transitions, glassmorphism, and dynamic theme customization
- **State Management:** Scoped Zustand stores (`src/stores/`) for client-side state hydration
- **Database & Modeling:** MongoDB with Mongoose schemas (`src/models/`), weighted text indexes, and compound SKU/barcode indexing
- **Unified B2B Service Layer Pattern:** Centralized client/server service modules (`src/services/`) supporting dual operational modes:
  1. **Live Production API (`isMockMode = false`):** Routes requests to REST API endpoints using `apiClient.ts`.
  2. **Developer Sandbox Mode (`isMockMode = true`):** Persists data arrays directly in `localStorage` for rapid offline feature prototyping.

## ✨ Comprehensive Application Features

### 1. Enterprise Multi-Field Search Service & Live Auto-Suggest
- **SKU-First Priority Engine:** Search queries prioritize exact/partial SKU matches (e.g. `TSH-BLK-XL`), Product IDs (`_id`), and variant barcodes above standard titles, categories, and descriptions.
- **Header Live Auto-Suggest (`GlobalSearchInput.tsx`):** Debounced (200ms) instant auto-complete popup on desktop and mobile headers showing product thumbnails, stock status pills, matching SKUs, and category jump links with full keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Enter/Escape).
- **Exact SKU Match Banner:** Displays a highlighted match banner at the top of the search page when an exact SKU query is detected.
- **Reusable `<ProductSearchPicker>` Modal:** Enables admins and merchants to quickly search and select products/SKUs for Coupons, Manual Collections, and Custom Invoice lines.
- **Database Performance Indexing:** Compound indexes on `colorVariants.subVariants.sku`, `barcode`, `hsnCode`, and a weighted text search index (`title`: 10, `tags`: 5, `seoKeywords`: 3, `description`: 1).

### 2. Algorithmic Trending Products & New Arrivals
- **B2B Category-Balanced Sales Volume Algorithm (`getTrendingProducts`):** Aggregates non-cancelled order items to calculate sales volume per product. Guarantees top product representation for every active category before merging overall high-volume products.
- **Dynamic New Arrivals (`getNewArrivals`):** Queries active products created within the last 7 days. Uses client-side `useEffect` state resolution in [ProductCard.tsx](file:///e:/FAKHRI/flexsell/flexsell-wholesale/src/components/storefront/ProductCard.tsx) to prevent server-client SSR hydration mismatches.

### 3. B2B Bulk Variant Purchase Matrix & Multi-Tier Pricing
- **Tabular Variant Matrix:** Allows wholesale buyers to view all Color, Size, and Weight combinations in a single matrix and enter order quantities for multiple SKUs simultaneously.
- **Multi-Tier Price Resolution (`priceTierHelper.ts`):** Resolves prices dynamically based on the active user customer type (`B2C`, `B2B`, `Dropshipping`), minimum order quantities (MOQ), and volume discounts.

### 4. Indian GST Taxation Engine & Commercial Invoicing
- **Intrastate vs. Interstate Split:** Automatically applies **CGST (9%) + SGST (9%)** for home state shipments (Madhya Pradesh) vs. **IGST (18%)** for out-of-state shipments.
- **HSN Code Tax Summaries:** Groups taxes per HSN slab. Supports inclusive vs. exclusive pricing toggles.
- **Commercial Tax PDF Invoices & Quotes:** Print-optimized stylesheets for generating commercial PDF invoices and instant cart quotes without external heavy PDF libraries.

### 5. Warehouse Inventory & Camera Barcode Scanner
- **Camera Barcode Scanner:** Integrated camera scanning using `html5-qrcode` on mobile and desktop browsers to scan physical barcodes and adjust stock levels on the fly.
- **Code 39 SVG Encoder:** Browser-side generator that converts SKUs into scannable SVG barcodes.
- **Warehouse Audit Ledger (`StockLog.ts`):** Persisted log tracking every inventory change (manual edits, barcode scans, order deductions, CSV bulk imports).
- **CSV Bulk Import/Export:** Export stock levels to CSV, make bulk edits in spreadsheet software, and re-import to update warehouse stock.

### 6. Unified Service Layer Subsystems
- **Customer Addresses (`customerService.ts`):** Shipping/billing address management with mock fallback key `"flexsell-addresses-storage"`.
- **Product Reviews & Moderation (`reviewService.ts`):** Customer ratings/reviews submission and admin moderation with mock key `"flexsell-reviews-storage"`.
- **Commercial Coupons (`couponService.ts`):** Coupon creation, category/product eligibility validation, and discount calculation with mock key `"flexsell-coupons-storage"`.
- **Notifications & Webhooks (`notificationService.ts`):** Real-time activity alerts and webhook integrations under mock keys `"flexsell-notifications-storage"` and `"flexsell-webhooks-storage"`.
- **Inquiries (`inquiryService.ts`):** B2B wholesale bulk quote request handling under mock key `"flexsell-inquiries-storage"`.
- **HSN Records (`hsnService.ts`):** Master HSN tax slab management under mock key `"flexsell-hsn-storage"`.
